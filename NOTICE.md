# surgeist-shape

## Dependencies

This dependency inventory covers `surgeist-shape` 0.1.0 with the repository's
default Cargo features for `aarch64-apple-darwin`. The enabled normal and build
dependency graph was checked with
`cargo tree --offline --locked -p surgeist-shape -e normal,build --target aarch64-apple-darwin` against the
existing local `Cargo.lock`. That lockfile is ignored by Git, so the versions
below describe this inspected resolution; another resolution or downstream
configuration can require different attribution. No build-only dependencies are
enabled in this configuration.

The inventory records dependency relationships and does not establish that
upstream source code or binaries are redistributed with this repository. It
excludes optional packages present only in the lockfile, upstream development
dependencies, and other repositories. The project's own license remains in
[LICENSE](LICENSE).

License texts were copied unchanged from the exact-version Cargo registry
packages. The accompanying Kurbo author list comes from its recorded upstream
source revision. Each component retains its upstream choice of MIT or Apache
License 2.0; inclusion here does not select one alternative.
